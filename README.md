This GitHub contains all the information for my dissertation such as codes, results and references:  

The codes for the machine learning algorithms where produced in google colab and a saved copy is included in this repository.  
The codes are;  
* loading_images: This code shows how google drive is monunted to the colab, the zip file containing all the images is extracted and saved. Then the images are counted based on their class and set (train/test/valiation)
* VGG16: The machine learning code for the VGG16 model used to perform multiclass classification
* VGG19: The machine learning code for the VGG19 model used to perform multiclass classification
* ResNet 50: The machine learning code for the ResNet 50 model used to perform multiclass classification
* InceptionV3: The machine learning code for the InceptionV3 model used to perform multiclass classification

I have also included a links section which has all the links to websites and tutorials used in the learning and creation of the machine learning models.  

There also is a link to my google drive to download the dog eye images zip file.  

There is also a results section (6 classes document), this section contains the accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix and time taken to run for each machine learning model using different epoch sizes.
